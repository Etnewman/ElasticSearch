This is the "certs" directory for the elastic repo.  It should exist under the "install" directory in the elastic repo.

The public cert along with the private key for each Elastic and logstash node should be present in this directory when preforming
the initial installation of Elasticsearch on a DCGS enclave.

The naming convention for each elastic nodes cert files is:
    xxxsu01elxx.crt
    xxxsu01elxx.key

The nameing convention for each Logstash node cert files is:
    xxxsu01lsxx.crt
    xxxsu01lsxx.key

    Where xxx is the site designator.  (ex: s00, t00)


The ROOT CA and SUB CA chain should be in the file
    elastic_cachain.pem


All of these files are required to preform the initial installation of Elastic.
