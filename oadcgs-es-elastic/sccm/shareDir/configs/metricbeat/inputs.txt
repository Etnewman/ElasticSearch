#
# This file contains a list of all applications
# that metricbeat is to monitor.  A unique portion
# of the application name is used to identify if the
# application is running on a host.  If the application is
# found to be installed on the host then the associated
# metricbeat configuration will be inserted into the yml.
# Configuration files should be placed in the inputs.d
# directory.  Files should contain a section for the 'apps'
# section of the appmonitor params, with a following comma
# (see inputs.d/example_config.yml).
#
# Enter one application per line like this:
# application name=config.app  (Do not enclose in quotes)
# Examples:
# mcafee endpoint security=endpoint.app
# configuration manager client=ccm.app
#
# Note: The above examples are commented out with the pound sign.
#       Any line that begins with a pound sign in this file is
#       ignored.  Do not begin lines that should be evaulated
#       with a pound sign.
