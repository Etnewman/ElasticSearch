#
# This file contains a list of all applications
# that filebeat can collect data from.  A unique portion
# of the application name is used to identify if the
# application is running on a host.  If the application is
# found to be installed on the host then the associated
# filebeat configuration to collect data for that application
# will be copied to the host. Configuration files should be
# placed in the inputs.d directory.
#
# Enter one application per line like this:
# application name=config.yml  (Do not enclose in quotes)
# Examples:
# mcafee endpoint security=endpoint.yml
# configuration manager client=ccm.yml
#
# In the case of a singleworker pipeline application, then :SW should
# be appended to the end like this:
# application name=config.yml:SW (Do not enclose in quotes)
# Example:
# REnDER=render.yml:SW
#
# Additionally, the singleworker pipeline can be set by
# appending -SW at the end of a config file name like this:
# (in \configs\filebeat\) filename-SW.yml
# Example:
# ls01.filebeat-SW.yml
#
# Note: The above examples are commented out with the pound sign.
#       Any line that begins with a pound sign in this file is
#       ignored.  Do not begin lines that should be evaulated
#       with a pound sign.
